# About the Project
  Liver cirrhosis is a chronic condition where healthy liver tissue is replaced by scar tissue, impairing liver function. This project uses a dataset from the Mayo Clinic's study on primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC),
  involving 418 patients from 1974 to 1984. The dataset supports predictive modeling for cirrhosis stages, aiding diagnostic and clinical decisions.
